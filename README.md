# Java_Advanced
The "Java Advanced" course examines working with the Java language. In the course you will learn to work with linear data structures, solve algorithmic problems (problem solving skills), work with streams, files and directories, as well as create template classes. Attention is paid to the functional programming paradigm, as well as to the main tool based on it - Stream API for processing data streams.

Additional information for tasks' code: In some of the exercises, the classes are written in a single file, because the logic for performing the tasks is for the purpose of presenting the approach and the cleanliness of the code.
